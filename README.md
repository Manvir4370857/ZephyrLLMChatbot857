An example chatbot using [Gradio](https://gradio.app), [`huggingface_hub`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.22.2/en/index), and the [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index).
The code sets up an interactive chat application using Gradio and HuggingFace's Inference API to discuss scientific skills. It features a predefined system message about the importance of scientific knowledge and skills. Users can ask questions, and the application generates contextually relevant responses based on user input and configurable parameters.
